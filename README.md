# CNN-for-Classifying-Happy-Sad-Faces

In this code I used the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces, 40 happy and 40 sad to create a
convolutional neural network that trains to 99.9% accuracy on these images, which cancels training upon hitting this training accuracy threshold.
